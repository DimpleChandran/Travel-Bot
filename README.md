# Travel-Bot
A recent research survey had shown that 87 % of travel users would prefer to interact with a travel bot than a human if it could save them time and money. 
Chatbots have gained increasing importance with a lot of applications available today including Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. In this project, the underlying methods and technologies behind a Chatbot for e-tourism are proposed with the purpose of booking hotels, planning trips, and asking for interesting sights worth visiting. In particular, we can understand how model-based reasoning can be used for enhancing user experience during a chat. 
This chatbot harnesses the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to facilitate natural, user-friendly conversations. It empowers users to effortlessly inquire, book flights and hotels, receive personalized travel recommendations, access real-time weather updates, and even perform currency conversions.
Chatbots can act as personal travel assistants to help customers browse flights and hotels, provide budget-based options for travel, and introduce packages and campaigns according to consumersâ€™ travel behaviour. 
That is the reason why Chatbots currently play a significant role in the travel industry, and its prevalence will only continue to rise in the coming months and years.
